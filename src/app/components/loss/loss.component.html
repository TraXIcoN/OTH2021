  … Your will has wavered. The Dark Lord’s words have softened you. <br />
  You are deemed no longer worthy of wielding the power. But the Wheel is
  forgiving and the world needs its savior. <br />
  Therefore, you are sent back to the beginning. Witness the turning of the
  Wheel, witness the ages repeating themselves and prove your calibre again…
